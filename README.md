# P.A.R.H.

It's bookmarklet made for hacklet, a HackClub Project.

## What it does?

### ✅Attention Checker
It Tracks how long do you read a certain paragraph --> Probably you didn't understand that paragraph or was just boring LOL

### ✅Paragraph Finder
Don't remember where you read a certain information? --> You can reach every paragraph with just a click!

### ✅Reading Helper
Didn't understand something? Selecting the paragraphs manually it's so annoying! --> Just select it with the checkbox next to the the related paragraph and Click "Open Gemini"! You will be a CTRL+V away from your answers.
